Demeter
=======

The Law of Demeter (LoD), or Principle of Least Knowledge, is a simple design style for developing software with the following guidelines:

* Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
* Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
* Only talk to your immediate friends.

Installation
------------

	sudo gem install demeter

Usage
-----

	require "demeter"

	class User
	  extend Demeter

	  demeter :address

	  attr_accessor :name
	  attr_accessor :address

	  def initialize
	    @address = Address.new
	  end
	end

	class Address
	  attr_accessor :country
	end

	user = User.new
	user.address.country = "Brazil"
	user.address_country
	#=> Brazil

If you are using ActiveRecord, you don't have to extend the `Demeter` module.

	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	  has_one :address
	  demeter :address
	end

	user = User.first
	user.address_country

You can easily override a method that has been "demeterized"; just declare it before or after calling the `demeter` method.

	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	  has_one :address
	  demeter_address

	  def address_country
	    @address_country ||= address.country.upcase
	  end
	end

To-Do
-----

* Allow more than one level
* Automatically create accessors
* Detect all `has_one` and `belongs_to` relations and automatically "demeterized" them on ActiveRecord
* RDoc
